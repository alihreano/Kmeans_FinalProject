 unnormalized spectral clustering algorithm : The project aims to develop a Python 
implementation of an unnormalized spectral clustering algorithm, utilizing a Python 
interface and a Python C API wrapper. Spectral clustering utilizes eigenvectors from a 
similarity matrix to cluster data points, and the objective is to create a streamlined and 
scalable implementation suitable for integration into Python-based applications
